# ParallelHashing

## Description
This project uses threading and multiprocessing to parallelize the hashing of strings into buckets. 

## Directory
This repository includes two Python programs and testing text files: 
- hash_procs.py contains the implementation of a parallel hash table using multiprocessing. 
- hash_threading.py contains the implementation of a parallel hash table using threads.
- text.txt contains 500 English language words.
- text2.txt contains 3000 English language words.
- text3.txt contains 100,000 English language words.
